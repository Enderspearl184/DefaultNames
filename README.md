# DefaultNames
a mod for Town of Salem 2, which randomizes the names of all other players when enabled.

NOT ON SALEMMODLOADER YET BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS. (for now there's a release if you need the dll and are unable to build the mod yourself)

# customizing the name list
The Names.json file can be found in (SteamLibrary)\Town of Salem 2\SalemModLoader\ModFolders\DefaultNames

You can change, delete, and add new names to the list however you see fit by editing this file!

If the Names.json file is ever deleted, it will be recreated with the default lists, which may be useful if you break something lol

If you can't find the SalemModLoader directory, click the yellow chest icon in the "Manage" section of the SML settings, and go up a folder.
